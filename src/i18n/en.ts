      "Born and raised in the heart of La Fortuna, I grew up surrounded by the wonders of the rainforest. From childhood explorations along volcanic trails to earning my Bachelor's degree in Ecological Tourism from the University of Costa Rica, my passion has always been sharing the magic of Costa Rica's biodiversity with visitors from around the world.",
    storyP2:
      "With over 13 years of professional experience as a naturalist guide, I bring a deep, personal knowledge of the local ecosystem — the secret spots where sloths sleep, the trails where toucans feed, and the streams where poison dart frogs thrive. I've guided tours across the entire country, from the cloud forests of Monteverde to the pristine shores of Corcovado, but La Fortuna will always be my home and my greatest passion.",

      "My mission is to create authentic, unforgettable connections between people and nature, while supporting conservation and the local community. When you book with Rain Forest Experiences, you're not just getting a tour — you're gaining a friend in the jungle.",
